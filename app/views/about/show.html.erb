      <h1>Personal Summary</h1>
        <p>Like many web frameworks, Ruby on Rails uses a variant[17] of the Model/View/Controller (MVC) architecture pattern to organize application programming. In a default configuration, a model in a Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database. By convention, a model named User will map to the database table users, and the model will have a filename user.rb within app/models. While developers can choose to use whatever model name and database table name they wish, this is not a common practice and it's usually discouraged because Rails philosophy is to use convention over configuration. A controller is the component of Rails that responds to external request from the web server to the application, and respond to the external request by determining which view file to render. The controller may also have to query the model directly for information and pass these onto the view. </p>

In a default configuration, a model in a Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database. By convention, a model named User will map to the database table users, and the model will have a filename user.rb within app/models.  A controller may contain one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, action is typically a basic unit which describes a single rule on how to respond to a specific external web-browser request. Also note that, if a controller/action is not mapped to the Rails router, the controller/action will be directly inaccessible to external web requests. By convention, Rails encourage developers to use a RESTful route which contain actions named create, new, edit, update, destroy, and index, as these are routed automatically by convention in the routes file if specified</p>
